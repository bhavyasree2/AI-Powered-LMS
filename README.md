# LMS Project - Learning Management System

This project aims to build an **AI-powered Learning Management System (LMS)**  to manage courses, assignments, and student progress.
The LMS will feature an interactive frontend, a robust backend, and Python-based analytics to enhance student performance and provide personalized learning paths.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the student and teacher dashboards.
- **Backend**: Play Framework (Scala) for handling courses, assignments, and user management.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing student and course data.
- **Python**: For analyzing student performance and providing AI-based insights.

## Project Structure

### **1. `frontend/`** – **Frontend React.js Code**
This folder contains the frontend code built using **React.js**, which handles the user interface of the LMS.

- **`public/`**: Public assets (e.g., HTML files, images).
- **`src/`**: Core React logic, components, pages, and styles.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components like buttons, forms, and cards.
  - **`pages/`**: React components representing pages for routing (e.g., dashboard, login).
  - **`App.js`**: The main entry point for the React app.
  - **`index.js`**: Entry file for rendering the React app.
  - **`styles.css`**: Global CSS for styling the app.
- **`package.json`**: Lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
- **`README.md`**: Frontend-specific documentation on setting up and working with the frontend.

### **2. `backend/`** – **Backend Code Using Play Framework**
The backend code is developed using the **Play Framework** and handles API endpoints, business logic, and data models for the LMS.

- **`app/`**: Contains application logic and components.
  - **`controllers/`**: API endpoints for handling requests like creating and managing courses, assignments, and students.
  - **`models/`**: Data models representing the structure of student, course, and assignment data.
  - **`services/`**: Contains business logic for processing data and implementing LMS functionality.
  - **`views/`**: Play Framework views (minimal if using React for frontend).
- **`conf/`**: Configuration files (e.g., for database and application settings).
- **`build.sbt`**: Build configuration for Play Framework (including dependencies and build settings).
- **`README.md`**: Backend-specific documentation on setting up and running the backend.

### **3. `database/`** – **Database Scripts and Migrations**
This folder contains SQL scripts and migration files to manage the database.

- **`migrations/`**: SQL migration scripts to modify the database schema over time (e.g., adding new tables or columns).
- **`schema.sql`**: The initial schema to set up the database structure.
- **`seed.sql`**: Sample data used for testing purposes.

### **4. `analytics/`** – **Python Scripts for Analytics**
This folder holds Python scripts for analyzing student performance and providing insights using AI.

- **`models/`**: Contains machine learning models used for performance analysis and personalized learning paths.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation with data analysis and machine learning algorithms.
- **`analysis.py`**: Main Python script for analyzing student data and generating reports.

### **5. `tests/`** – **Testing Files**
This folder includes test files for ensuring the correctness of the frontend, backend, and analytics components.

- **`frontend/`**: Tests for frontend components and functionality.
- **`backend/`**: Tests for backend API endpoints and business logic.
- **`analytics/`**: Tests for analytics and machine learning models.

### **6. `.gitignore`**
Specifies which files and folders Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules/`, `build/`, `.env` files).

### **7. `README.md`** – **Main Project Documentation**
This is the main README file for the overall LMS project, providing an overview of the system, its purpose, and how to set up and contribute.

### **8. `LICENSE`**
The licensing information for the project, specifying the terms of use and distribution.

## How to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LMS-Project.git
   cd LMS-Project
   ```

2. **Set Up Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend/` folder.
   - Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the development server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

3. **Set Up Backend**:
   - Navigate to the `backend/` folder.
   - Set up and run the Play Framework application using `sbt` (Scala Build Tool):
     ```bash
     cd backend
     sbt run
     ```

4. **Set Up Database**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Apply the migrations and seed the database with sample data:
     ```bash
     psql -U <your-username> -f database/schema.sql
     psql -U <your-username> -f database/seed.sql
     ```

5. **Run Analytics**:
   - Install required Python packages (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
   - Run the `analysis.py` script to analyze student data:
     ```bash
     cd analytics
     python analysis.py
     ```
